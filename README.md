**E-Commerce web store:**

**Description:** Worked in a team of five people to create a web store that interacts with a database. The website keeps track of a userâ€™s personal information, orders, and product inventory. While it is relatively minimalistic, it is a fully functioning website that would allow users to browse, purchase, and receive products. It also includes and employee/owner control panel.

**Tools:** 

 - GitHub as a version control platform
 - MariaDB as a DBMS
 - PHP, CSS, SQL, HTML

**My focus:**  

 - Creating SQL scripts that tests 
 - Creating and optimizing safe SQL queries
 - Displaying products/details of products to the consumer
